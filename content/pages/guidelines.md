> Development Team: emo is a safe community for authentic expression. Only post videos about Live and don't break any laws. Don't spam people or post any photos that are too nude and revealing. Respect everyone, coexist in diversity, and be different!

We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us make emo a place where everyone feels safe and comfortable being themselves. By using emo, you agree to these guidelines and our [<font color=#f62198>Terms</font>]({{< ref "/pages/terms.md" >}}) of [<font color=#f62198>Privacy</font>]({{< ref "/pages/privacy.md" >}}). Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or other restri ctions.

## ABOUT

<font color=#979797>
The inspiration for emo came from the development team's rebellion against mainstream culture. We felt that social shouldn't be an excessive beauty economy. That's why emo turned off photo albums when it released Post, in the hope that people would post more live events that were happening. Especially in the post-covid-19 era, the real world and our relationship are becoming increasingly fractured. We encourage people to get out more and not let the world become an enclave.

Predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people’s personal information, and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate the Terms of Use are taken very seriously — we will kick you out.
