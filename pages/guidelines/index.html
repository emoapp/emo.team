  ABOUT

    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>

</h2>
<font color=#979797>
The inspiration for emo came from the development team's rebellion against mainstream culture. We felt that social shouldn't be an excessive beauty economy. That's why emo turned off photo albums when it released Post, in the hope that people would post more live events that were happening. Especially in the post-covid-19 era, the real world and our relationship are becoming increasingly fractured. We encourage people to get out more and not let the world become an enclave.
